# <a name="_g6lr508ioxbp"></a>Operation: Check Classinfo
<https://thinkland.ai/classinfo/>

- Must be Admin to login
- Understand the UI:


- 上课时间还没有到 upcoming (early)，不显示​ dot
- 到上课时间了没有点名 missed call (in class time)，显示红色dot​
- 10分钟内点名了 Class On (good job!)，显示绿色dot​
- 10分钟后才点名 Class On (late call)，显示黄色dot​
- ---------​
- 如果点名了学生人数不全（有学生no-show），显示 ! (感叹号)

1. **Class Change: red number indicates the number of requests that are unprocessed:**

`	`See [Operation: Check Class Change Request](#_n7ykdkmtll31)

1. **Today’s class: non-green dot indicates there is an issue with the class that needs to be checked.**

1) **Attendance is submitted but there is no-show student.**

Green means that the teacher submitted class attendance on time.

But the Exclamation point (!)  indicates student no-show. Check who is missing, and try to follow up with the teacher and the parents why they were absent.

For instance here, Mike followed up with the teacher Ms. Wiley to confirm who were absent. Also, asked why the absent student was not sent class report.


For instance here, the parent replied why Ryan was absent from the class. Mike replied to the parents, as well as forward the parent’s email to the teacher, and inform in Discord:




1) **No attendance is submitted by the teacher**


Red Dot 

Must follow up with the teacher to remind them to submit class attendance at the start of each class, even if the class was over.

Hello

Let me reiterate

1\. There is no pass or fail in the evaluation. Our mission is to make you a teacher, as long as you want to be.

The evaluation is just a way for us know (roughly) how your current teaching level is, and how familiar you are with the teaching materials.

That’s why we kept improving the evaluation method to simplify the process. 

2\. We will NOT reply to each individual about how the evaluation goes. If there is a match (course level, skill, time), we will contact you. 

For the past few weeks, we have contacted many new teachers and many of them are teaching now.

If you didn’t hear from us, sure, you can reach out to us asking. However, I’d suggest that you look for TA or STEM for All teaching positions, to gain teaching experience.

I do want to assure you that we look at every evaluation video submitted. We view this as the trust you have in us. We don’t take decisions lightly.

Hi Jojo Shum,

It's 08:00 2023-03-03 now.

AI002L1-10-2023S class starts at 19:00 2023-03-02 ET.

Please always submit student attendance at the start of class.

Click here to submit: <https://school.thinkland.ai/user/index.php?id=1759>

\-------------------------------------------------------------

~~Why it is important for you as the teacher to submit class attendance:~~

~~1. Send a reminder message to absent student' parents. It is OK to submit multiple times if still no student shows up after first submitting at the start.~~

Could you please write the Evaluation and Recommendation for your students this week?

# <a name="_j3yeg110brdl"></a>Teacher：Teaching Logistics
**1st class is very important:** 

- We offer students/parents a free tryout class as the opportunity to experience before signup. If they like it and continue, this tryout class will be paid. If not, it is not paid. 

**Teaching Quality is what matters**

- Our “100% Satisfaction Guarantee” policy to parents is free to 1) change teacher; 2) change class; 3) cancel a class at any time for refund, if dissatisfied with the class. 
- Teaching performance is measured on how many students in your class continue taking the next-level class. Feedback from the students and parents is the sole criteria that we review.

**How to deal with student no-show：**

- If there is NO student coming at the start of your class time, 1）you must submit class attendance, which automatically triggers notification to absent student’s parents, and 2）you SHOULD contact OPERATION TEAM in Discord immediately. Our office will try to contact the students/parents through other ways (e.g. text message). You can end the class if no student shows up 10 minutes after the class starts.

\- Teacher working form

`    `- Must fill out the form before being paid: <https://forms.gle/gzweGteduAFiSDh29>

`    `- Must provide employment eligibility proof documents. Please read the I-9 form instructions and follow them.

`    `- Provide Zelle account holder name if the account is not under your name



\- Teaching payment

`    `- Payment is calculated based on your class report. So, it is very important to fill out every class report after each class.

`    `- As long as the student is enrolled in the class (i.e. the tuition is paid), the calculation of that class size includes absent students. So, it is important to submit the class report for absent students too.

`    `- Our “Satisfaction Guarantee” policy to parents is free to 1) change teacher; 2) change class; 3) cancel a class at any time for refund, if dissatisfied with the class. Our office will make adjustments to your class report to reflect that. For example, we will remove the absent student from the pay calculation at the start or end of the attendance, if the parents didn’t pay tuition for those classes.

`    `- We offer students/parents a free tryout class as the opportunity to experience before signup. If they like it and continue, this tryout class will be paid. If not, it is not paid. Our office will make adjustments to remove the tryout student from pay calculation if not to continue.

`    `- If there is NO student coming at the start of your class time, you must submit class attendance, which automatically triggers notification to absent student’s parents, and MUST contact Office (DM MikeL#3966 in Discord) immediately. Our office will try to contact the students/parents. You can end the class if no students show up after 10 minutes after the class starts. You will NOT be paid for a no-student class.

`    `- You can ask for Pay Sub if you are not clear how your monthly payment is calculated or think the amount doesn’t match your own calculation. (DM MikeL#3966 in Discord),

- About class change - you won't be able to teach in your regular class time, for whatever the reason:
- The guiding principle is that we view the class as a signed contract with the parents/students, so we will do as much as we can to teach on the regular class time.
- The reason is simple: it takes way too much effort to align you the teacher with all the parents/students in another class time, and many dissatisfaction.

So :

1) First, we will look for a substitute teacher. Whoever teaches the class will be paid for that class (TA is first considered to substitute);

If a substitute teacher is not available, we will reschedule the class, by simply adding the makeup class to the end of the session (semester).

1) If you absolutely have to make the  change request, submit it here as early as you can.

# <a name="_jvlmgcx3uf59"></a>Teacher：About Class Video

The video is automatically recorded to Zoom cloud during the class

We cannot keep it there for long, because the Zoom cloud space is limited. We upload the video to YouTube.

After the class, download the video for your copy.
# <a name="_dljcbocum97i"></a>Teacher：Youtube Video
Ali, we are going to use YouTube to store class videos. 

So, after each class, download the class recording from Zoom and then upload to Youtube. Put the Youtube video link to the class report.

I have added you as editor to our YouTube channel, check your email to activate. 

While uploading to YouTube, make sure that you enter class information (see the illustration below) for the video:

1\. Title: add class name, level, lesson or day #, and date

2\. Description: teacher's name, date, class code

3\. Create a Playlist name for your class, and add all the lessons to it. - this is important. Your class can be found easily with the playlist name.

Here is an example (Ali's class):

<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/859272685917044767/998042113533034617/unknown.png>

something you might want to introduce to your python/java students is the Advent of Code (<https://adventofcode.com/2021>)

It's a series of problems that open from Dec 1 to Christmas that might be interesting for your students as practice. It's usually based more around reading files and doing data analysis, so might be above their skill level. But, it's always worth a try introducing to them

Plus, there's always old problems to give them, if they really want more

# <a name="_v1pnxksqdyyn"></a>FAQ 合作伙伴：上课有3种模式：

1\. 我们的计算机课是以在线课为主，因为电脑上课在线更有优势，同时又能有更多优秀老师资源，还有也不需要有教室的费用，以及电脑（学生自己的）；上课也是任何时候都可以

2\. 如果是在教室里上in-person的课，

1）需要告知下具体地址，我查一下附近是否有老师，以及是否有老师愿意去上线下课

2）学生自己带电脑，教室里有网络

3）教室和学生电脑的费用我们是不负责的。

3\. 上Hybrid的课，老师远程在线，线下教室里有学生和助教TA，TA有一台电脑与老师连接，投影到projector或大屏幕电视：

1）助教需要John学校这边找到人来支持，中学生就行，对电脑要懂但不需要来教，协助老师

# <a name="_fxnpa3vouf3s"></a>
# <a name="_l4bbbu2l34q7"></a>FAQ 家长问答：普通班 与 定制班的区别
我们普通课是可以如果不喜欢，不继续第一节课不收费，继续的话是收费。

定制课是上课了就收费的。

我们的课是保证 如果不喜欢，任何时候可以退课，要求refund（remaining class) 的。 

普通班 人多，学费高，老师愿意上。但那样不能针对学生个人情况来上。所以1on1，但学费即使$50 也不如3-4人班

而且普通班是按照设计课程时间来的，比如Java 4个level 64 课时，定制班减少到 40课时

1) **1对1的课**


1on1 class Is what we call personalized, or customized class. 

With 1 student, you teach at the pace of how the student can learn.

In regular class, the teaching is at the pace of the designed curriculum.

The teaching rate for 1on1 class is $25 hourly.

The parents/student often choose to continue a 1on1 class that covers the entire curriculum of Core Python or Java, if you teach well.

—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We only choose experienced teachers to teach 1on1 class.

在小班课的基础上，有提供更多的CS方向的课。

1on1的课是根据学生的进度来上课的，这与小班课不同。

**2）小班课只能根据课程设计的pacing来上课**

小班课一般是3人以上；1对1是$50 hourly; 一节课有1小时，1.5小时，也有2小时的；这个是看课程的设置；一般孩子小，每次课时间会控制在1小时内。

哦，还要提一点：小班课因为是多人上课，上课进度是按照课程设计来；如果是1对1，课程进度是按照孩子的学习情况来；所以学的快的孩子会比较好

# <a name="_uko21a869mvx"></a>FAQ 家长问答：微信回复

# <a name="_s21uzhwrgvjb"></a>FAQ 家长问答：什么时候开学试课
1. 报名夏季课 6/5那周开始；
1. 我们这边会留意，如果有其他学生报名能合班现在开始的，马上通知家长；
1. 也可以要求1对1上课，那样是可以按照家长和孩子时间上课，但费用会高些（因为就1个学生）


一个星期，几节?

- 夏季课有2周，4周，5周，8周，还有10周的；每周1次，2次到5次的 都有的
- 可以查看夏季课表：<https://school.thinkland.ai/schedule>


# <a name="_xck3lja4wqvr"></a>FAQ 家长问答：上课老师
老师会不同吗

老师会不同，两个原因：1）我们认为学生去上不同老师的课是一个很自然的事，就像学校里每个年级的课老师很大可能是不同的；2）我们的老师众多，这发挥了我们的优势（也是网课的优势）

当然我们理解家长的 想法，如果希望是同一个老师继续，我们会尽量安排

# <a name="_cmufjln8frto"></a>FAQ 家长问答：Java课程
Java 一共4个level：<https://school.thinkland.ai/AI005Java.pdf>

level 1&2 是基础知识，level 3&4 是针对 AP CS A考试的

现在是level 1有一定了解，那开始上课从level 1加level 2，然后 3&4.

每个level是16课时，那如果level 1算8个课时，8+16+16+16 = 56课时。

可以争取40课时学完（粗略估计），因为还要看学习过程的情况，还有是有homework的。
# <a name="_wmjr4oytbya3"></a>FAQ 家长问答：补课安排
1\. 一般补课是会在这个session结束，加一节课。这是系统会自动设置的。

2\. 如果是在另一个特定时间补课，系统会问家长是否OK，同时老师也会在课堂上问同学。只有所有学生都是OK的，系统才会设置。

3\. 上课的内容就是按照课程安排来顺着上，不是去补某一节课的内容

\-------------------

1\. 每次上课后会发class report带有上课录像，缺课了可以看录像，有问题可以邮件或通过学校message问老师。

2\. 如果需要，可以要求老师在下次课前10-15分钟早到问问题。

3\. 如果需要，可以问老师是否可以补课，我们会与老师协调（我们不能要求老师一定补课，因为正式课已经上过了）。

另外，如果课前通知了我们，我们可以来协调换课：只要这个班里所有同学/家长和老师同意，我们可以安排换上课时间（比如放到这个session最后加一次），但只要有一个学生不同意，我们只能在原定计划上课

这个补课policy是基于老师上一次课拿一次工资；如果是老师原因课没上，老师一定要补上；同样的我们不能要求老师上两次课但拿一次工资。

其实很多老师是会愿意给学生补课的，我们也会尽量协调。但不能保证。

# <a name="_5jc74yiiukg2"></a>FAQ 家长问答：Makeup class

Anoushka — 02/15/2023 3:53 PM

Hi Mike, one of the parents of my students (I think) forgot that his daughter had class on Tuesday and hes asking if I can teach the same lesson at different times (I don't). What do i do? Do I just tell him no and direct him to the class recording or make time for the class she missed?

MikeL — 02/15/2023 3:54 PM

Basically say no but reply in a nice way. 

Tell that you don't teach the same lesson at different times.

Explain why you can't teach twice - because this is a multiple-students class that you have to teach in regular class time. 

And tell the parent that the class video is available to watch, and if the student has questions after watching the video, you can be reached by email ( ), and you can also help by being in the class 10 minutes prior to the next class (if you can).

You can point the parent to reach out to the office that there may be another class that teaches the same lesson, by another teacher. The office may be able to help.



Hi there,

Unfortunately, I don't teach the same lessons at different times. Mostly because AiGoLearning's multi-students classes are scheduled to teach in specific time slots so that all students in the same class learn the same thing and have the same time to absorb material and work on homework.

However, you can reach out to the office and see if there is another class by a different teacher who is teaching the same material within this week.

Lastly, I have recorded this class and the recording is up online. Amanda can spend time looking at the part of class she missed, go through the materials (also posted on Thinkland) and do the homework. I am available throughout the week on email to help with any issue she'll be stuck on. I can also start the next class 10 minutes earlier and Amanda can hop on earlier so that I can help with concepts face to face that she's confused with before the new class starts. 

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Anoushka

School rules:

- If the student is absent more than once, submit the 2nd class report as being absent and no makeup. (unless the parents notify in advance, like in Albert Zhang’s case)

- If the class times are changed 3 times in a session, we charge one class fee
# <a name="_6bp88icew3oi"></a>FAQ for Parents：Teaching Quality
We take a different approach on teaching now. Given that we have a lot more teachers, we prefer to break up the class for small size.

Because small size class help the students learning as well as helping the teacher teaching , therefore better teaching quality.

We now have personalized class (1on1) that teaching pace is up on how fast the student can learn. 

In other words, our priority is on teaching quality and the students/parents' satisfaction. It is more important for them like our class and the teacher, so they are more likely to continue taking next level class with us after a session is finished.

# <a name="_t9awd8eruq5s"></a>Email（to parent）: 课程介绍
Hi Ling，

课程内容：

Roblox:  -----------------

基础：需要孩子学习过Scratch或Python，对编程或游戏设计有基本理解。

材料要求：电脑上下载Roblox Studio。

完成课程后达到的水平：能够独立设计不同类型的Roblox游戏。

Minecraft：-------------------

基础：不需要任何编程基础。

材料要求：下载Minecraft Education Edition。购买Minecraft Education年费会员（12$/Y)。

完成后达到的水平：由于将根据孩子的的年龄选择不同的课程，所以选择不同课程的孩子将达到的水平不同。初级的Minecraft的课程专注于Blockly Coding。学生将通过解决Minecraft游戏世界中的谜题学习Blockly Coding培养计算思维能力以及问题解决能力（类似于Scratch，但可能更有趣）。高级的Minecraft课程将学习Python或Javascript编程语言，同样是通过在Minecraft游戏世界中解决问题的形式。学习完成后将达到Python编程语言的初级水平。

是，第1堂试课；我们保证家长和孩子满意，下面是我们的Policy：

\------------

\- 第一堂课试用：如果您不喜欢并且不继续，第一堂课免费。（如果继续，则收费）。

\- 退款：您可以在任何时候 要求 1) 更换老师； 2) 班级变更； 3）退款（剩余课程）如果对课程不满意或孩子不感兴趣了。

\------------

谢谢

Elaine

3个针对zoom的便利功能，免费提供给任何中文学校使用：

1）自动分配zoom账号到各个班级；

2）自动读取邮件发送验证码；

3）自动读取邮件发送recording。

现在zoom登录要验证码搞得我们的老师和运营很头大，整天要担心登录不了zoom。我们自己做了一个小程序，来读取邮件中从zoom发来的验证码，然后发给登录的老师。

要实现这个功能，需要在接收zoom验证码的邮箱里加一个自动转发zoom这个邮件的filter。

这是如何设置的说明：<https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DxnUf_FrnsPV4zLrmDp_9kBPVunyFsPfYmD-CGEmfk/edit?usp=sharing>

Subject：Zoom账号应用 



校长 你好， 



我们针对中文学校线上课程管理开发了一款Zoom账号管理应用，该应用主要包含三大功能： 



1\.自动分配Zoom账号到各使用班级，最大限度利用Zoom账号，节约成本； 

2\.展示Zoom登录验证码，减少运营负担 

3\.展示Zoom课后录像，减少运营负担

AI course cooperation in 2022 

Dear Principal, 

We Thinkland AI is an educational service provider specialized in providing AI programming courses for young people in the United States, and the only computer and AI course partner of the National Association of Chinese Schools (CSAUS). We have cooperated with more than 50 Chinese schools (Boston, NY/NJ, Phildelphia, Florida, Chicago, California and Hawaii). 

Our curriculum focuses on cultivating children's interest in programming, contacting and experiencing AI. It is developed based on the concept of project-based learning (PBL) and systematized. Children can contact from the age of 5 to 7, and can be upgraded gradually, from 000 - "001 -" 002 - "003 -"... Each course has different levels (sessions). One session is 16 class hours. Now there are 272 class hours in total, and the continuation rate reaches 80%. Our competition courses train high school students to take the AP Computer Test and the USACO Computer Olympics. 

Details: https://school.thinkland.ai/aboutus.pdf   

Our winter course starts from the week of December 26 https://school.thinkland.ai/2022Winter   

We hope to become a partner. We provide courses/teachers/class management. Your school will recruit students and share half of the profits. My email address is mike@thinkland.ai , the phone number is (+1) 201-238-5309. 

thank you,

# <a name="_x6s25x9d5lps"></a>Email (to parent): summer class Summer II 课程报名 
主题：AI课程Summer II期下周7/25开始 

{:fullname}家长 你好，  



今年暑期已经过了近一半，祝孩子玩的开心！还有一个半月，按照我们16课时一个level的课程设计，我们安排了暑期II的课程，具体的课程安排请看： 

https://school.thinkland.ai/summer 



有几个特色我提一下： 

8月份USACO camp：这是给初高中孩子今年底参加USACO（美国计算机奥林匹克竞赛）做参赛准备的夏令营，集中备考，2周1期，8/1-12是初级；8/15-26是高级，共2期。了解更多：<https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tEEza9GDexBMHVfzxiT2qw> 



定制课1对1，根据学生个人情况来安排课程内容和进度, 让孩子在短期内能集中学习Core Python 或者Java的知识，为后面学习编程语言的应用打基础。同时上课时间灵活，可以根据学生和家长的时间来安排。 



测评Evaluation。很多家长在报课前不知道孩子已掌握的程度，或者学习了后也不了解。我们推出Evaluation服务，老师1对1孩子，半小时测评。 



Have a happy summer! 



谢谢  

Mike

Subject：定制化AI课程 Customized AI Class 

{$full\_name} 家长· 你好， 



在收到家长对小班课中不能针对单个学生的学习进度来加快上课进度的问题，我们在6月推出了定制化课程试点，效果很好，现全面上线。 

﻿ 

Customized class is perfect for student who want to learn in their own pace. 



可以根据学生个人情况来调整上课进度。Core Python和Java的全部64课时可以在40课时内完成 （具体时长看个人情况）。 

上课时间灵活，因为是1对1，可以根据学生和家长的时间来安排上课。 

还可以跨课程的定制课程学习，比如Python 或 Java 结合 web 开发。 

现在最热门的定制化课程有： 



1\.Learn Core Python in 40 hours 

2\.Learn AP Java in 40 hours （可以考AP Computer Science A） 

3\.Learn Web Development in 40 hours （可以考 AP Computer Science Principles) 



对要参加定制化课程的学生，我们会先进行1对1的evaluation 。 



如有对定制化课程感兴趣的家长，欢迎联系（可以直接回复邮件 mike@thinkland.ai，或微信联系 Michael, ID 是 TeensTeachKids ）

Subject：定制化AI课程 Customized AI Class 

校长，你好， 

我们针对家长提出的小班课中不能针对单个学生的学习进度来加快上课进度的问题，我们推出了定制化课程试点，效果很好，现全面上线。 

Customized class is perfect for student who want to learn in their own pace. 

可以根据学生个人情况来调整上课进度。Core Python和Java的全部64课时可以在40课时内完成 （具体时长看个人情况）。上课时间灵活，因为是1对1，可以根据学生和家长的时间来安排上课。还可以跨课程的定制课程学习，比如Python 或 Java 结合 web 开发。 

现在最热门的定制化课程有： 

1\.Learn Core Python in 40 hours 

2\.Learn AP Java in 40 hours （可以考AP Computer Science A） 

3\.Learn Web Development in 40 hours （可以考 AP Computer Science Principles) 

对要参加定制化课程的学生，我们会先进行1对1的evaluation 。 

如有合作意向，欢迎联系（可以直接回复邮件 mike@thinkland.ai，或微信联系 Michael, ID 是 TeensTeachKids ） 

谢谢

Subject:Invitation to FutureHacks Five 2023 (April 14-16 ) 



{$firstname}家长 你好, 



我们的Hackathon到第5届了！FutureHacks 是专门面向中小学生的免费在线青少年编程竞赛。参与者在4月X日-X日周末以个人或者组队的形式创建自定义项目，在线提交并呈现给专家评委团。 



中小学生可以参与不同年龄段和不同编程语言(Scratch、Scratch+AI、Python、Java、HTML/CSS)的竞赛，今年的FutureHacks准备了价值 $6000 的奖品，实时演示课及多达10场的工作坊。还特别为年龄较小的小学和初中学生设立了 Junior（7-13岁）组别，可以在老师的指导下参赛竞争最佳创意奖。 



我们的这次比赛强调学生展示编程能力，更希望给每个参赛者一个机会，把自己的作品实时展示给专家评委，其中包括现在人工智能领域的大牛专家(Google，Apple，Facebook等)和顶级大学学生(Princeton, Columbia, UC Berkeley等)。 



在此我们邀请{$firstname}免费参加FutureHacks Five 2023，作为学习课程的扩展，可以直接点击下方按钮网上报名。 



有任何问题，可以联系上课老师，或扫描下方微信二维码加入我们的微信群。 



谢谢， 

FutureHacks 2023
